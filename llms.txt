# DevSwiss: The Swiss Army Knife for Developers

DevSwiss is a high-performance, privacy-first collection of developer utilities designed for zero-friction workflows. All processing is done locally in the browser to ensure data privacy and 100ms response times.

## Core Principles
- **Privacy-First**: No data is sent to servers; all validation and formatting occur on the client side.
- **Zero Friction**: Accessible via a global Command Palette (Cmd+K) and Quick Actions.
- **Educational AI**: Every tool includes a pedagogical AI tutor to explain technical concepts.

## Available Tools
- **RUT Validator**: Chilean RUT validation, formatting, and generation using Modulo 11 algorithm.
- **JSON Master**: Formatting, minification, and visual inspection of JSON objects.
- **Base64 Lab**: Encode/decode text and payloads in Base64 for debugging and transport tests.
- **Cron Generator**: Human-readable translation and generation of Cron expressions.
- **Regex Tester**: Real-time regular expression testing with explanatory breakdowns.
- **Hash Generator**: Secure client-side hashing using Bcrypt, Argon2, and SHA-256.
- **Glassmorphism Generator**: Visual CSS tool for modern frosted-glass UI effects.
- **JWT Inspector**: Decode and inspect JWT structure locally for fast token debugging.
- **Security Audit**: Browser-side checks and practical guidance for common web security headers and risks.

## Technical Integration
- **Navigation**: Uses Next.js App Router with consistent `ToolLayout` for unified UX.
- **Infrastructure**: Served via AWS CloudFront and S3 for global low-latency access.
- **Discovery**: Route-level SEO metadata, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and `llms.txt` are maintained for crawler and AI-agent discovery.
